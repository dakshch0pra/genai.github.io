            <h2>How Generative AI Works</h2>
            <ul class="content">
                <li><h3>Define the Objective</h3>
                    <p>Start by clearly specifying what you want the AI to generate (e.g., text, images, music). 
                    A clear goal helps guide the training process and ensures the AI produces the desired type of content.</p>
                </li>

                <li><h3>Data Collection and Preprocessing</h3>
                    <p>Gather large and diverse datasets relevant to your objective. Clean and organize this data to remove any noise or errors, ensuring it is suitable for training the AI model. 
                    Proper preprocessing improves the quality and reliability of the training data.</p>
                </li>

                <li><h3>Choose the Right Model Architecture</h3>
                    <p>Select the most appropriate AI model for your task, such as GANs, VAEs, or Transformers. Each model type has specific strengths and weaknesses, 
                    so choosing the right one is crucial for achieving the best results based on your dataset and goals.</p>
                </li>

                <li><h3>Implement the Model</h3>
                    <p>Build the neural network by defining its layers and connections. Utilize frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch, 
                    which offer pre-built components that simplify the implementation process, making it easier to set up the model.</p>
                </li>

                <li><h3>Train the AI Model</h3>
                    <p>Introduce the training data to the model sequentially, allowing it to learn patterns and structures. Adjust model parameters to reduce errors between generated output and intended results. Training requires significant computational 
                    resources and time, and monitoring progress helps fine-tune the model for better performance.</p>
                </li>

                <li><h3>Learning Patterns and Structures</h3>
                    <p>During training, the AI model identifies and learns patterns, structures, and relationships in the data. 
                    For text generation, it learns grammar and syntax; for image generation, it recognizes objects, textures, and colors.</p>
                </li>

                <li><h3>Probabilistic Generation</h3>
                    <p>The model generates new content based on probability distributions learned during training. For example, in text generation, it predicts the likelihood of each word following the preceding words, 
                    and in image generation, it predicts pixel values to form coherent images.</p>
                </li>

                <li><h3>Evaluate and Optimize</h3>
                    <p>Assess the performance of the model by measuring the quality of the generated content against the desired output. 
                    If the results are unsatisfactory, adjust the model architecture, training parameters, or dataset to improve performance.</p>
                </li>

                <li><h3>Refinement through Feedback</h3>
                    <p>Continuously improve the model by generating content, receiving feedback, and adjusting parameters accordingly. 
                    This iterative training process helps the model produce more accurate and realistic content over time.</p>
                </li>

                <li><h3>Fine-tune and Iterate</h3>
                    <p>After initial evaluation, identify areas for improvement and make necessary adjustments. Incorporate feedback from users, 
                    add new training data, and refine the training process to enhance the modelâ€™s performance continuously.</p>
                </li>

            <ul class="content">
                <li><h3>Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)</h3>
                    <p>Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a type of artificial intelligence that create new data by 
                    having two neural networks compete against each other. The generator network makes fake data, while the discriminator network tries to tell if the data is real or fake. The generator improves by learning how to fool the discriminator, and the discriminator gets better at spotting fakes. This process allows GANs to generate highly realistic data, 
                    such as images and videos, and has various applications in creative fields, data enhancement, and more.

                </li>

                <li><h3>Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)</h3>
                    <p>Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) are neural networks that generate new, similar data by encoding input into a 
                    probabilistic, lower-dimensional space and then decoding it back. Unlike traditional autoencoders, VAEs add randomness to this process, enabling them to create diverse samples. This makes them valuable for generating realistic images, data compression, and detecting 
                    anomalies, as they balance accurate reconstruction with a smooth latent space distribution.

                </li>

                <li><h3>Transformer Based Models</h3>
                    <p>Transformer-based models are a type of advanced AI technology introduced in 2017 that have revolutionized how 
                    computers understand and generate human language. Unlike older models, transformers process entire sequences of data at once rather than one step at a time, making them faster and more efficient. They are widely used in applications like language translation, text generation, and chatbots. By using mechanisms like self-attention to focus on the most relevant parts of the input data, 
                    transformers can produce highly accurate and nuanced results. Their versatility and power have made them foundational in modern AI.

                <li><h3>Diffusion Models</h3>
                    <p>Diffusion models are a type of machine learning tool used to generate new data, such as images or sounds, by gradually transforming simple, random noise into complex and realistic outputs. 
                    They work by starting with basic data and applying a series of changes to make it resemble something more intricate, like turning static into a clear image. These models are particularly good at producing high-quality results and are versatile in applications like image generation, editing, 
                    and creating content from text descriptions. They offer advantages like stable training and impressive detail in their outputs.

                <li><h3>Setting up LLMs</h3>
                    <p>Large language models, also known as LLMs, are very large deep learning models that are pre-trained on vast amounts of data. The underlying transformer 
                        is a set of neural networks that consist of an encoder and a decoder with self-attention capabilities.
