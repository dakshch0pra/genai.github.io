            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <ul class="content">
                <li><h3>What is Large Language Models(LLMs)</h3>
                    <br>
                    <p>Large language models, also known as LLMs, are very large deep learning models that are pre-trained on vast amounts of data.
                    The underlying transformer is a set of neural networks that consist of an encoder and a decoder with self-attention capabilities.
                    In simpler terms, an LLM is a computer program that has been fed enough examples to be able to recognize and interpret human 
                    language or other types of complex data.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <h2>How LLM Models Work</h2>
            <ul class="content">
                <li><h3>Machine Learning and Deep Learning</h3>
                    <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are built on machine learning, a subset of AI, which involves feeding a program large amounts of data to 
                    train it to identify features without human intervention. LLMs use deep learning, a type of machine learning that enables models to train 
                    themselves to recognize distinctions using probability, requiring some human fine-tuning. By analyzing vast amounts of data, such as trillions 
                    of sentences, deep learning models can learn to predict how to logically finish an incomplete sentence, generate new sentences, and understand 
                    language patterns, including identifying common characters and predicting their likelihood of appearance in English-language text.</p>
                </li>

                <li><h3>Neural Networks</h3>
                    <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) like myself are built on neural networks, inspired by the human brain. These networks have multiple layers of interconnected nodes that process and transmit information, with each layer passing output to the next only if it crosses a certain threshold. 
                    This architecture enables LLMs to learn from vast data, recognize patterns, and generate human-like language.</p>
                </li>

                <li><h3>Transformer Models</h3>
                    <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) use transformer models, a type of neural network that learns context through self-attention. 
                    This allows them to understand how elements in a sequence relate to each other, enabling them to interpret human language, even when it's vague
                    or unconventional. By processing vast amounts of text, LLMs can associate words and concepts by their meaning, effectively "understanding" semantics and grasping context in a way that other machine learning models can't.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>How to build your own LLM?</h2>
            <ul class="content">
                <li>
                <p>Developers building LLM applications face challenges in storing and accessing large datasets, including costly infrastructure investments and data egress fees. 
                Cloudflare offers a solution with its Vectorize service, a globally distributed vector database, and Cloudflare Workers AI, a development platform. These tools enable developers to easily 
                store, query, and experiment with LLMs without incurring massive egress fees, making it more accessible to build AI applications.</p>
                </li>

                <li><h3>Specialize</h3>
                    <p>An LLM can help you specialize in a specific field of law and gain in-depth knowledge.</p>
                </li>

                <li><h3>Research Skills</h3>
                    <p>An LLM can help you develop research skills, which are important in the legal field.</p>

                <li>
                <p>LLMs, like ChatGPT, are widely used in generative AI to produce text based on prompts. They can generate essays, poems, or code, 
                and are trained on large, complex data sets, including programming languages. Besides generating text, LLMs assist in various tasks 
                such as sentiment analysis, DNA research, customer service, chatbots, and online searches. Examples include ChatGPT (OpenAI), Bard 
                (Google), Llama (Meta), Bing Chat (Microsoft), and GitHub's Copilot, which specializes in coding.</p>
