            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <ul class="content">
                <li><h3>What is Diffusion</h3>
                    <br>
                    <p>Diffusion is a natural process that happens all around us. It's when particles, information, or energy move from an area where they are concentrated to an area where they are less concentrated. Imagine spraying perfume in a room. At first, the scent is strong where you sprayed it, 
                    but eventually, it spreads throughout the room. This spreading out is diffusion at work.</p>
                </li>

                <li><h3>Diffusion in Machine Learning</h3>
                    <p>In the world of machine learning, diffusion models are used to create new data, like images or sounds, based on existing data
                    These models learn patterns from the data they are trained on and use these patterns to generate new, similar data.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <h2>How Diffusion Models Work</h2>
            <ul class="content">
                <li><h3>Starting Simple</h3>
                    <p>Diffusion models begin with something simple, like random noise (imagine static on a TV).</p>
                </li>

                <li><h3>Transforming Step-by-Step</h3>
                    <p>They then apply a series of small changes to this noise, gradually 
                    turning it into a more complex and realistic image or data point.</p>
                </li>

                <li><h3>Learning the Process</h3>
                    <p>The model learns how to make these changes by studying lots of examples of the kind of data we want it to create.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            
            <h2>Types of Diffusion Models</h2>

                <li><div class="good">Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs)</div><br>
                    <ul class="bullets">
                        <li><b>Purpose:</b> These models are great at cleaning up noisy images, making them look clearer.</li>
                        <li><b>How They Work:</b> DDPMs start with a noisy image and, step-by-step, remove the noise to create a clear image.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li><div class="good">Score-Based Generative Models (SGMs)</div><br>
                    <ul class="bullets">
                        <li><b>Purpose:</b> SGMs are used to estimate how likely certain data points are.</li>
                        <li><b>How They Work:</b> They use a function called a "score function" to understand the 
                        local structure of data and generate new data points that fit well with what they've learned.</li>
                    </ul>

            <h2>Applications of Diffusion Models</h2>
            <br>
            <ul class="content">
                <li><h3>Image Generation</h3>
                    <p>Diffusion models can create realistic images based on the data theyâ€™ve been trained on, 
                    such as generating new human faces that look real.</p>
                </li>

                <li><h3>Image Editing and Restoration</h3>
                    <p>They can improve or restore images, such as removing noise from old photographs or 
                    filling in missing parts of an image.</p>
                </li>

                <li><h3>Text-to-Image Creation</h3>
                    <p>These models can generate images from text descriptions. 
                    For example, you can describe a scene in words, and the model will create an image of that scene.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <h2>Utility of Dillusion Models</h2>
            <br>
            <ul class="content">
                <li><h3>High-Quality Images</h3>
                    <p>They produce images with fine details and fewer artifacts.</p>
                </li>

                <li><h3>Stable Training</h3>
                    <p>They are generally more stable to train compared to other models like GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks).</p>
                </li>

                <li><h3>Versatility</h3>
                    <p>They can be used for a wide range of tasks, from image generation to data completion.</p>
